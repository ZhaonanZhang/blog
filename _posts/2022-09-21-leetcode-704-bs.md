title: LeetCode 704 Binary Search (Java)
---

#### Problem : Easy

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/):
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

#### Thought

To solve this problem, first of all is to understand the given constraint: 
- All the integers in nums are **unique**.
- nums is **sorted** in ascending order.
- 
Binary Search works best if it is a sorted array and there are only unique numbers and this makes searching the target number easy.

#### Steps:
- Calculate the middle index to half the array repeatedly. To do this we have to figure out the lowest and highest index of the array first.
- We use the middle index to control which part of the array it traversing of. MiddleIndex = lowIndex + (highIndex-lowIndex)/2
- In a while loop, when lowIndex and highIndex meets, break. The **Final middle index is the index of the target value**.
- If the target value doesn't exists, return -1 outside the while loop.

#### Solutions: Java


class Solution {
public:
    int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int mid = 0;
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length-1;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            mid = low + ( high - low ) / 2;
            if(target==nums[mid])
                return mid;
            
            else
                if(nums[mid]>target)
                    high = mid-1;
            else
                low = mid+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
